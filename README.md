# Hi
I'm Demir and I have been coding for a little while. Below I have attached a table that showcases what stuff I know. 

|Coding language | Proficiency |
|----|----|
| C++ | Learning |
| Lua | Learning |
| HTML (yes I know its a markup language but still!!!) | Learning |

## What am I currently working on?
I am trying to lock in on HTML (and by extension, CSS) to make a presentable github page 📍
